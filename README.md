# A Travel Planner Agent 


The Challenge:

A Travel Planner Agent is an AI-powered assistant that helps users plan trips efficiently and intelligently.  
It uses real-time data to suggest destinations, build itineraries, and recommend transport and accommodation options.

By understanding user preferences, budgets, and constraints, it tailors personalized travel plans.  
Integrated with maps, weather updates, and local guides, it ensures a smooth travel experience.  
The agent can also manage bookings, alert users to changes, and optimize schedules on the go.  
This smart assistant transforms complex travel planning into a seamless, enjoyable process.
